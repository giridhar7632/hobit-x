        <h1>Hobit App</h1>
  <p>An app to track your bite-sized habits</p>
     </div>

This is an quantized version of my app [hobit](https://github.com/giridhar7632/hobit). I made this to work offline focusing on privacy.

<!-- ## ✨ About

I often forget to do things on time, and adding reminders to my calendar just made it harder to see my schedule. That's why I created **Hobit** — to help people like me remember the small habits we don't want to miss. It lets you set daily, weekly, and monthly goals, track your progress, and get timely reminders to keep you on track. 

**Current Status:** First version of the app is live. You can download the APK in the github releases to test.

## 🚀 Features

- **Simple Habit Tracking**: Easy tracking of habits
- **AI-Powered Points System**: Earn points for sticking to your habits.  
- **Streak Tracking**: Keep your streaks alive and build long-term habits.  
- **Activity Graph**: Visualize your progress for each habit over time.  
- **Timely Notifications**: Get reminders exactly when you need them. *(Currently on hold due to the lack of a push API key)*.
